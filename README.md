# Kaggle-Titanic
A Kaggle project using Logistic Regression
tools used are Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sklearn
The model predicts that a person in the Titanic Survives or not based on required attributes 


This Submission.csv file contains ''PassengerId'' and "Survived" attribute which is predicted by my training model.
my trained model gave prediction close to 77% in test data I filled missing values with median of the same column to respective Passenger classes.
Simple steps I followed:
1. Collection of Data
2. Analysis of Data (used seaborn for some Histograms, countplots, heatmaps)
3. Cleaning of Data (Dropped one column which is mostly null and mostly unique)
4. Training of Data (Sklearn inbuilt class)
5. Accuracy check (Sklearn inbuilt methods)
6. Testing Data 
7. Submission  (converting Data frame to csv)
